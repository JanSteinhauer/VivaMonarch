Migration is a journey that connects us all, crossing borders, ecosystems, and even oceans. It’s not only monarch butterflies that embark on these incredible voyages—whales are also among nature’s great travelers. Each year, various whale species migrate vast distances, some traveling thousands of miles to reach warmer breeding waters or richer feeding grounds. These migrations are essential for their survival, but they also highlight the delicate balance of our global ecosystem.
